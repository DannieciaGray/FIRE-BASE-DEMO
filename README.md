Respository also contains 
python script 

# FIRE-BASE-DEMO
This is my firebase demo which should connect to raspberry pi. 


Next Steps:
Navigate to the folder where your Python script is located:

If your script is saved in a subfolder, use the cd command to change directories. For example, if your script is in Documents, you would run:

bash
Copy code
cd Documents
If it's in another folder, adjust the path accordingly, for example:

bash
Copy code
cd path\to\your\script
Run the Python script:

Once you're in the correct folder where the script is located, run the script using:

bash
Copy code
python firebase_demo.py
If your Python version is python3, use this command instead:

bash
Copy code
python3 firebase_demo.py
This should execute your Python script, and you should see the output in the Command Prompt.
